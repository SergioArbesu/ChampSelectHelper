## Pick a champion during Champ Select



## The app runs in the background!

You don't need to have the settings window open. The app will run in the background and connect to the League of Legends client even when the settings window is closed. If you want to stop the app, select Quit when right-clicking the system tray icon.

## What happens when a patch changes the runes/spells/skins?

Nothing! The app will continue to work with the updated runes/spells/skins. Keep in mind that you will have to change your settings if something you had selected, like a rune, gets deleted or replaced by another one.
